# atomiX build, test & deploy — operational reference

**This is the single, canonical command reference for the project.** It covers
building, the full test surface, and real hardware deployment.  It is
maintained: whenever a milestone adds or changes a build, test, or deploy
command, this file is updated in the same change (see
[design-checklist.md](design-checklist.md) → change-ready checklist).

Architecture lives in [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md); component contracts in
[components/README.md](../components/README.md); host setup and tool quirks in
[dependencies.md](dependencies.md) and [toolchain.md](toolchain.md).  This doc
is *what to run*, not *why*.

All commands are run from the repository root unless a `-C <dir>` says otherwise.

## Continuous integration

Every command in this file is meant to be reproducible by hand.  CI runs the
ones that need no hardware, so a stale claim surfaces as a red build rather
than as a surprise months later.  The workflows live in
[`.github/workflows/`](../.github/workflows) and are split by cost, not by
subject:

| Workflow | Trigger | Covers | Tier needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | push, PR | manifest-defined ISS, profile, cosim, unit, component, and QEMU-free aXos suites | Core |
| `nightly.yml` | 03:17 UTC daily | full integrated CI replay, Live FPGA faults, accelerator/architecture paths, randomized campaigns, official ISA, and three-platform checks | Core + Kernel |
| `formal.yml` | Sundays 04:23 UTC | bounded riscv-formal instruction proofs, both cores | Formal |

The split follows the tier table above: `ci.yml` needs only the Core tier, so
it runs on every change.  Anything needing QEMU ≥ 7 or the formal stack builds
that tool itself and therefore runs on a schedule instead.

FPGA synthesis, place-and-route, and physical-board results are deliberately
**not** in CI.  Keeping physical claims separate from simulation claims is a
project rule ([design-checklist.md](design-checklist.md)); a green build never
implies a working bitstream.

## 0. Prerequisites (tiers)

Install only the tier you need; details in [dependencies.md](dependencies.md).

| Tier | Tools | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| Core | `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc` (rv32 multilib), Verilator, Python 3, GNU make | build + simulation + component tests |
| Kernel | `qemu-system-riscv32` **≥ 7** | aXos S/U-mode boot checks |
| Formal | current Yosys, SymbiYosys, riscv-formal | `make -C formal check`, `check-ax2` |
| FPGA | OSS CAD Suite (Yosys, board flow tools, openFPGALoader) | synthesis + board deploy |

The board component selects the flow: ULX3S uses ECP5 (`nextpnr-ecp5`, `ecppack`),
Tang Nano 20K uses Gowin (`nextpnr-himbaechel`, `gowin_pack`).  Both ship in the
OSS CAD Suite; `make -C rtl/fpga check-tools` verifies the ones the selected
board needs.

Pass a non-default QEMU as `QEMU=/abs/path/to/qemu-system-riscv32`.  Load the
FPGA environment once per shell: `source "$HOME/opt/oss-cad-suite/environment"`.

## 1. The pipeline at a glance

```
 profile ─▶ build ─▶ test ───────────────▶ (synth ─▶ deploy)
 configs/   images    ISS · cosim · RTL       ECP5     ULX3S
            & ISS      roles · kernel · host   bitstream board
```

| Stage | Entry command | Proves |
|---|---|---|
| Profile | `make config-check-all` | every profile resolves to compatible components |
| Build | `make -C sim/axsim test` · `make -C sw/baremetal images` | golden ISS + a target image |
| Test | `make component-test` (+ the suites in §3) | selected components compose and run |
| Synth | `make fpga CONFIG=configs/ulx3s-85f.json` | the shell places and routes on ECP5 |
| Deploy | `make -C rtl/fpga program` | the bitstream runs on a real board (reversible) |

## 2. Build

### Protocol emulator host checkpoint

```bash
make pemu-model-check   # ISA drift, assembler, C model and firmware checks
make pemu-cosim-check   # Verilated RTL against the C model, cycle for cycle
```

The model command requires a host C compiler and Python. The cosimulation adds
Verilator and checks the RTL pin/output trace cycle by cycle against that model.
Both run in smoke, quick CI and nightly verification. The differential stage
compares every cycle: scalar and control timing, the shift engine and `WAITE`,
across 112 deterministic randomized programs and twelve directed cases, with no
tolerated deviation. A run that is exact except for one duplicated cycle is
named as an undeclared retirement handoff rather than left to be diffed by
hand, because that was this design's standing defect. I2C firmware and a
platform oracle for SPI remain open, and none of this is FPGA or silicon
evidence. See
[model conventions](../sw/pemu/model/README.md) and the
[PE-05 evidence](../research/benchmarks/axpe-cosim.json).

### Choose / inspect a profile
```bash
make component-list                              # catalog of selectable components
make component-show COMPONENT=role.gpu-compute   # one manifest
make external-component-check                    # portable package + conformance
make experiment-regression-check                 # exact preview CPU regression gate
make config-check   CONFIG=configs/sim-bram.json # resolve one profile
make config-check-all                            # resolve every profile in configs/
```

### Build the pieces
```bash
make -C sim/axsim axsim         # the golden ISS binary
make -C sw/baremetal images     # bare-metal .elf/.bin/.hex (hello, timer, role, tpu, gpu, ...)
make -C sw/kernel   images      # aXos image (build/axos_boot.{elf,bin,hex})
```

aXos build knobs (append to the `sw/kernel` command):

| Knob | Effect |
|---|---|
| `HOSTLINK=1` | host-managed personality: the console pipe carries the host-link protocol instead of the interactive shell |
| `STORAGE=1` | mount the AXFS SD image path |
| `KERNEL_CONFIG=configs/kernel-cooperative.json` | select an alternate kernel-service profile |

### Run one image on a selected SoC profile
```bash
make sim CONFIG=configs/sim-bram.json \
  RAM_INIT_FILE="$PWD/sw/baremetal/build/hello.hex"

make software CONFIG=configs/sim-axos.json   # build + run the profile's software component
```

### Open an interactive session on a profile

A `run` is batch: it consumes a fixed script, then prints the whole transcript.
Every `check-*` target uses that, and it is what a self-checking test wants. To
*type* at the machine instead, build the model once and keep it open — in batch
mode each exchange is a separate process, so the machine reboots between
commands and nothing carries over.

```bash
MODEL=$(make -s -C sim/soc model-path \
  RESET_PC=0x80000000 \
  COMPONENT_CONFIG=../../configs/sim-role-loopback.json)
"$MODEL" --ram-image "$PWD/sw/kernel/build/axos_boot.hex" --uart-interactive
                                   # aXos prompt; Ctrl-D closes the session
```

Build the payload separately (`make -C sw/kernel images`). The model above has
no baked RAM image: reuse that same executable with `--ram-image` pointing at
another word-per-line hex file to boot a different program. Paths are relative
to the launch directory. For example, after `make -C sw/baremetal build/hello.hex`:

```bash
"$MODEL" --ram-image "$PWD/sw/baremetal/build/hello.hex"
make -C sim/soc check-runtime-payload   # reuse, baked parity, and session state
```

This works with BRAM (both read timings) and the delayed-memory model. The
pin-level SDRAM harness uses its ROM loader instead. Existing `RAM_INIT_FILE`
builds retain their baked default; `--ram-image` overrides it for one launch.
Selection happens before reset and does not change the model's RAM capacity or
entry address. The check writes simulation evidence to
`sim/soc/build/runtime-payload-evidence.json`.

State persists across commands: running the shell's `role` twice reports
`irq=1` then `irq=2`, because it is one machine rather than two boots. An
interactive run ends on console close or the finisher, so it is not bounded by
`MAX_CYCLES`.

Between keystrokes the machine is *stopped*, not spinning: `wfi` parks the hart
and the console is interrupt-driven, so the cycle counter holds still while it
waits for you. `console` in the shell reports which path input actually took —
`irq 21 polled 0 stalls 0` means every byte arrived as an interrupt. A platform
whose PLIC numbers its devices differently (QEMU's `virt`) falls back to polling
and says so there, rather than parking on an interrupt that will never arrive.

### What this host needs, and what it has been run on

```bash
make doctor                 # this host, against tools/requirements.json
make requirements-check     # fail if the host or the docs are outside it
make requirements           # regenerate the tables in docs/dependencies.md
```

[`tools/requirements.json`](../tools/requirements.json) is the single source of
truth for tool versions. It separates *supported* — the range accepted without
comment — from *tested*, which is what was actually run, with the evidence named
beside each version, and lists known-bad ranges with the reason each is known
bad. `make doctor` never fails and reports every tier; `requirements-check`
fails a host that is outside the requirement and fails the docs when they drift
from the file. It runs as the `requirements` stage of `smoke`, `ci-quick`, and
`nightly-integrated`.

Widening the tested set is deliberate work, not a note: run the evidence named
beside the tool, record the version in the JSON, and regenerate the docs.

### Open the same session in a browser

Optional tier, and load-bearing for nothing — it needs Emscripten
([toolchain.md](toolchain.md)) and no evidence claim rests on it. The same
Verilated model compiled to WebAssembly boots aXos in a tab with no toolchain
and nothing installed:

```bash
./tools/web.sh                 # verify headlessly, then serve and open the page
```

That is the whole thing from a plain shell. It sources the SDK (emsdk
deliberately does not touch your profile), prefers a Verilator the suite is
green on, builds the aXos payload if it has never been built, runs the headless
check, picks a free port, and opens the browser.

```bash
./tools/web.sh --check-only                        # verify, do not serve
./tools/web.sh --port 9000 --no-open               # pin the port, stay put
./tools/web.sh --config configs/sim-bram.json \
               --payload sw/baremetal/build/hello.hex
```

`make web` and `make web-check` call the same script with `WEB_CONFIG` /
`WEB_PAYLOAD`. The steps underneath stay available separately —
`make -C sim/web build|check|bench|serve` — and `make web-bench` times the WASM
machine against the native one on the same host.

Changing the payload does not rebuild the machine: the image is loaded into it
at run time, as with native `--ram-image`. Changing the *profile* does rebuild it, and
the bundle is keyed on the selection so a stale one is never served under a new
name.

The page is the same machine, not a re-implementation: clocking, the UART
handshake, and the SPI sampling edge all come from
`components/harness/common/soc_machine.h`, which the batch runner and the
interactive session use too, so a cycle count read off the page is the one a
local run reports. Details and measurements are in
[sim/web/README.md](../sim/web/README.md).

### Several machines side by side

One machine shows that a selection boots; it cannot show what the selection is
*worth*. This boots the same binary on several selections at once, each with
its own cycle count:

```bash
make web-compare                                   # build, verify, serve, open
make web-compare-check                             # verify only, do not serve
make web-compare WEB_MACHINES="sim-bram sim-ax2"   # a different set
```

The default set is `sim-minimal sim-bram sim-ax2`, which differ in exactly one
component — the core — so the spread between them is attributable rather than
merely observed. The payload is `sw/baremetal/build/cpu_perf.hex`, which reports
retired instructions and cycles per workload and prints a checksum every core
must agree on.

```bash
make web-page-check                                # all three pages, in a browser
AX_BROWSER=/path/to/chrome make web-page-check     # pick the browser
```

That drives the served pages in a headless Chromium and reads the rendered DOM
back, which is the only way to see the page rather than the machine: module
loading, asset paths, the scheduling loop, and whether any number reaches the
screen. It skips rather than fails when no browser is installed, and it never
terminates a browser process it did not start.

`make -C sim/web machines` stages one bundle per selection and `compare` runs
them headlessly, which is the evidence half: it fails if any machine misreports
which selection it is (`ax_profile()` against the label it was staged under), if
the checksums differ, or if two machines return the same cycle count — the last
being exactly what a page showing one machine three times would look like. The
native sweep behind the same numbers is `python3 tools/bench.py cpu`.

### Hand an experiment through the browser

`make web-compare` also stages the committed AX-01 same-binary records as AX-03
bundles. Follow the **Open one of these committed results** link, or share an
explicit selection such as:

```text
http://localhost:8000/handoff.html?bundle=experiments/cpu-perf-on-minimal.json
```

The page bounds and validates the bundle before selecting a machine, confirms
the profile and payload SHA-256 identities, runs the payload, and requires the
same oracle output, workload cycles, and total cycles as the native record.
Malformed, incompatible, oversized, and stale inputs are refused without a
fallback. After a pass, export the bundle and replay it with the ordinary native
command:

```bash
make experiment-reproduce EXPERIMENT_BUNDLE=/path/cpu-perf-on-minimal-browser.json
```

The browser observation is a namespaced extension; the AX-03 inputs and replay
command are unchanged. `make web-compare-check` exercises the portable contract,
including a non-default bundle-size limit. `make web-page-check` performs the
successful run and all four bad-link cases in a real Chromium. Without a browser
or Emscripten this optional path is unavailable; the native experiment commands
above remain unchanged.

---

## 3. Test

Run the narrowest check that covers a change, then the composition suite before
declaring a component or profile ready.

The shared suite manifest is the preferred integrated entry point. It is also
what CI and the scheduled workflows invoke, so local and hosted stage ordering,
timeouts, and logs cannot drift:

```bash
python3 tools/verify.py list
make verify-smoke
make nightly-integrated
```

See [verification.md](verification.md) for the coverage ladder and result
format. The individual commands below remain useful for focused development;
the manifest composes these targets and does not replace their Makefiles.

### 3.1 Core / fast
```bash
make -C sim/axsim  test        # ISS against the rv32 ISA suite
make -C sim/unit   test        # directed RTL unit benches (see `run-*` targets for one bench)
make -C sim/cosim  test        # Verilator lock-step cosimulation vs the ISS
```

### 3.2 Bare-metal, three platforms (ISS · QEMU · RTL)
```bash
make iss-emulator-check  # AX-12 adapter contract: same ELF, distinct counters
make -C sw/baremetal check-hello check-timer check-preempt check-fencei
make -C sw/baremetal check-spi check-sd            # RTL-only (SPI-SD path)
```

### 3.2a Games (RTL-only — they are driven by simulated UART input)
```bash
make -C sw/baremetal check-game2048     # turn-based tier: exact final state
make -C sw/baremetal check-snake        # interactive tier: exact state + no missed frame
make -C sw/baremetal check-snake-loader # the same game, uploaded into blank RAM
```
The first two replay a fixed key file through `UART_INPUT_FILE` and assert an
exact result, so a game is a regression like any other profile.  `check-snake`
builds the game at a compressed frame clock (`SNAKE_CHECK_HZ`, default 500)
because at the shipped 12 fps one frame is 2.08M simulated cycles; regenerate
its input tape with `python3 sw/baremetal/make_snake_tape.py`, which prints the
checksum the Makefile must then pin.

`check-snake-loader` is the architectural gate rather than a third game test:
it boots from the immutable ROM into blank RAM and uploads the program as an
`AXK1` frame, requiring the same checksum the baked image reaches.  Keep it
passing — it is what stops a program from becoming part of a bitstream's
identity.  To play either game on the board, see [games.md](games.md).

### 3.3 Accelerator roles (RTL-only — the ISS does not model the role window)
```bash
make -C sw/baremetal check-role     # role.loopback contract proof
make -C sw/baremetal check-tpu      # TPU-lite folded int8 GEMM vs on-core reference
make -C sw/baremetal check-gpu      # GPU-compute SIMT engine vs on-core reference (8-lane)
make -C sw/baremetal check-gpu-perf # GPU throughput regression vs on-core (8-lane)
make -C sw/baremetal check-gpu1     # gpu1 banked SIMT engine vs on-core ISA oracle
make -C sw/baremetal check-gpu-tpu  # resident GPU then TPU, guarded switch + retained state
make -C sim/unit run-gpu-tpu        # direct composite role ABI and both engines
```
The programmable and composite role components are tuned by parameter rather
than duplicated per size:

- `role.gpu1` — the current engine: banked global memory and a control ISA
  (divergence, branches, divide, shuffle).  Parameters: `lanes`, `banks`,
  `enable_div`, `enable_shfl`.
- `role.gpu-compute` — the earlier single-port engine, kept as the reference the
  gpu1 store-ordering semantics are matched against.  Parameter: `lanes`.
- `role.gpu-tpu` — a resident one-window composition of `gpu-compute` and
  `tpu-lite`.  `gpu_lanes` and `gpu_data_words` tune its GPU half; fixed
  metadata at offsets `0xfff0`–`0xfffc` discovers the pair and selects one
  native engine ABI.  Selection is rejected while either engine is executing
  or has an uncleared completion, and a switch does not reset engine state.

Software reads the geometry from the role's CAPS register, so `check-gpu1` is
the check for any parameterisation.  See
[hardware-capabilities.md](hardware-capabilities.md) for measured cycles.

### 3.4 Components / composition

Validate the vendor-neutral research descriptors and their exact workload
oracles independently of any FPGA toolchain:

```bash
make personality-check
make comparison-check
make experiment-check            # experiment plans, their records, and the contract's gates
make adapter-check               # the execution adapters' refusals: blocked, unsupported, bounded
make iss-emulator-check          # aXsim/QEMU adapters; requires the Kernel tier
make live-check
make l3-check                    # all-mode L3 shadow, canary, mutation, and rollback
make ecp5-frame-check            # compressed/full/partial frame decoder contract
make verification-check          # the suite manifest, the runner, and the command inventory
make coverage-map REPORT=1       # every advertised command and where its failures surface
make formal-coverage REPORT=1    # what the bounded proofs prove, and what they do not
make example-replay              # every documentation example, booted and compared
make evidence-views              # render formal coverage, cosim divergence, and rollback
make bug-report-check            # the report format's own failure modes
make bug-report EXAMPLE=baremetal-hello   # export a session anyone can replay
make bug-report RECORD=build/examples/report.json   # replay one from a clean session
make static-analysis             # RTL lint, C path analysis, C++, Python, shell
#   The RTL pass uses the selected simulator's exact source ordering.
make fuzz-loader                 # binary-format parser regression (ELF, AXFS, AXK1)
#   Findings land in build/static-analysis/fuzz.json in the same schema the
#   static analysis writes, so the nightly workflow puts both in one issue.
make fuzz-coverage               # line/branch reach of that corpus in the loader
make -C sim/fuzz explore         # unbounded ELF-loader fuzzing, for when it changed
make -C sim/fuzz explore-axfs    # unbounded AXFS-metadata fuzzing
make -C sim/fuzz explore-axk1-format # unbounded AXK1 upload-format regression
make -C sim/fuzz explore-hostlink-format # unbounded host-link request-format regression
make toolchain-llvm              # build and run the kernel with clang/lld

# TOOLCHAIN selects the target compiler; gcc is the default and every recorded
# size and fmax number was measured with it. clang 14 emits ~45% more text for
# RV32IM than GCC 10, and the page pool is what is left of RAM after the image,
# so a clang kernel needs more than the default 128 KiB to leave enough free
# pages for the ABI tests -- it boots and runs at 128 KiB, it just cannot
# allocate. That is a size difference, not a miscompilation.
make -C sw/kernel check-shell TOOLCHAIN=llvm RAM_BYTES=262144
make pr-gate-check               # partial-bitstream load gate: 7 gates, 12 rejections
make diagram-check               # every mermaid diagram is well formed
```

`pr-gate-check` always runs its synthetic 12-case policy regression. To gate a
real partial image, pass `DELTA`, `REFERENCE`, and `TRELLIS_DB` pointing at the
prjtrellis database; that device-geometry run is FPGA-tool evidence and is not
performed by ordinary CI.

`diagram-check` runs in `ci-quick`. Diagrams are documentation that breaks
silently -- a mermaid block with a typo renders as an error box on GitHub and no
ordinary build looks at it. The structural check needs no toolchain and no
network, so it is the one that runs every time.

To validate against the **real mermaid parser** rather than the structural
approximation, parse the blocks under `jsdom`. This needs Node and one npm
install but no browser, which matters because `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` pulls a
headless Chrome that will not install on every machine:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/mparse && cd /tmp/mparse
echo '{"name":"mparse","private":true,"type":"module"}' > package.json
npm install mermaid jsdom
# extract every ```mermaid block to a .mmd file, then for each:
node -e '
  const { JSDOM } = await import("jsdom");
  const dom = new JSDOM("<!doctype html><html><body></body></html>");
  globalThis.window = dom.window; globalThis.document = dom.window.document;
  Object.defineProperty(globalThis, "navigator",
    { value: dom.window.navigator, configurable: true });
  const mermaid = (await import("mermaid")).default;
  mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: false });
  await mermaid.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(process.argv[1], "utf8"));
' diagram.mmd
```

All 14 diagrams in this repository were checked this way on 2026-09-03: 14
parsed, 0 failed.

Kernel and ABI conformance, including the same program run against a profile
whose capacities are not the defaults:

```bash
make -C sw/kernel check-abi-torture        # adversarial ABI program, default caps
make -C sw/kernel check-abi-torture-small  # 2 task slots, 3 fds, 12-byte paths
make -C sw/kernel check-loader-wx          # loader refuses a W+X segment
make -C sw/kernel kernel-config-check-all  # every kernel profile resolves
```

`check-abi-torture-small` is not a duplicate run.  The program derives every
limit from the same `-D` the kernel was built with and asserts exact counts, so
a capacity that is hardcoded somewhere makes exactly one of the two runs fail.
Passing both is the evidence that the profile knobs are real; passing one is
not.  Both link at 1 MiB rather than the default 128 KiB, because cloning an
address space needs more than the ~15 free pages 128 KiB leaves.

```bash
make config-check-all              # all profiles resolve
make component-test                # runs the supplied composition matrix (slower)
make -C sw/baremetal check-suite-minimal   # lean-component family in one suite
make -C sim/unit run-suite-ax2            # every core.ax2 tier vs the official ISA suite
make -C sim/unit run-suite-gpu1           # every role.gpu1 tier vs the ISA oracle
make -C sw/baremetal check-suite-ax2      # ax2 + gpu1 SoC integration
```
Prefer **suites** over a check-plus-profile per hardware combination: a suite
exercises a family of components together.  `check-suite-minimal` runs
`core.minimal` driving the CPU (hello), the GPU role, and the TPU role from the
`sim-minimal*` fixtures.  Add a suite when a family of components (a new core,
an accelerator variant) warrants coverage without one-off profiles.

The ax2 and gpu1 suites show the shape to copy for a **parameterised** family.
Tier coverage lives in `sim/unit`, which builds each tier's RTL directly and so
needs no profile per tier; only the SoC-integration leg needs a profile, and it
needs one (`sim-ax2.json`, `sim-ax2-gpu1.json`), not one per tier.  A tier sweep
does not belong in `configs/` — the tiers differ only in parameters, and adding
a profile each would duplicate coverage the unit suite already has.

### 3.4a Tuning a component
```bash
python3 tools/configure.py describe core.ax2     # what it exposes and the defaults
```
A component is the unit of *architecture*; a size inside it is a build-time
parameter.  A new component is warranted when the architecture changes — a
different pipeline, a different privilege model, a different execution model —
not when a cache or a lane count changes.  So `core.ax2` is one component with
`issue_width`, `icache_kb`, and `btb_entries`, and `role.gpu1` is one component
with `lanes`, `banks`, `enable_div`, and `enable_shfl`.

A profile overrides by name, under the component's kind:

```json
{
  "components": { "core": "core.ax2", "role": "role.gpu1" },
  "parameters": {
    "core": { "issue_width": 1, "icache_kb": 8 },
    "role": { "lanes": 16, "banks": 16 }
  }
}
```

The manifest declares each parameter with the default that *defines the
baseline*, so an unparameterised profile is the reference configuration.
Overrides are validated: naming a parameter the component does not declare is a
configuration error that lists what it does declare, the same discipline that
makes component selection validated rather than hopeful.  Parameters reach the
RTL as `+define+` flags, because they must cross stock module boundaries
(`axcore`, `axrole`) whose port and parameter lists are shared with every other
implementation and must not grow implementation-specific knobs.

### 3.4b Benchmarking
```bash
make -C sw/baremetal images
python3 tools/bench.py cpu     # IPC per core and per ax2 parameter setting
python3 tools/bench.py gpu     # kernel cycles per role parameter setting
python3 tools/bench.py tpu     # int8 GEMM accelerator versus the host CPU
python3 tools/bench.py tang    # exact Nano/Primer max-profile wall-time view
python3 tools/bench.py render  # render workload vs cache policy/size and divider
python3 tools/bench.py         # all five
```
The sweep needs a profile per configuration, but those are measurement fixtures
rather than supported ones, so `bench.py` generates them into a scratch
directory instead of the catalog.  What it sweeps is mostly *parameters* now,
which is the point: the numbers show what each knob is worth instead of
asserting that several near-identical components differ.

The CPU sweep uses the workload-only `cpu_perf measured` cycle count, excluding
setup and UART overhead. The board payloads also print stable checksums and
time projections for 27 MHz Tang Nano and 25 MHz Tang Primer. GPU/TPU payloads
separate upload, doorbell-to-done compute, and readback-plus-verification from
the complete offload total. Those projected microseconds are pre-P&R; use the
achieved hardware clock as the final frequency.

### 3.4c Experiments: one workload, several implementations and targets

New to this? [`docs/experiment-alpha.md`](experiment-alpha.md) is the
walkthrough; this section is the command inventory behind it.

A benchmark answers a question this repository already chose.  An experiment
plan is a question a *user* brings: one workload and its oracle, the
implementations that claim to satisfy it, the targets that can host them, and
what may be spent finding out.  Plans and records live in
[`research/experiments/`](../research/experiments/).

```bash
make experiment-run                                   # the native/RTL saxpy plan
make experiment-run EXPERIMENT_PLAN=research/experiments/same-binary-cores.json
make experiment-run ONLY=saxpy-native LIMIT_SECONDS=60 REPETITIONS=9
make experiment-replay RECORD=research/experiments/records/saxpy-simt-rtl-lanes-8.json
make experiment-run RESUME=1                          # keep outcomes already recorded
```

Four plans ship, and they make different claims on purpose:

- `same-binary-cores.json` loads one unchanged `cpu_perf` image into
  `sim-minimal`, `sim-bram`, and `sim-ax2`.  The records carry one payload
  hash and three model hashes, so the difference is attributable to the core.
- `saxpy-native-vs-rtl.json` runs a host C executable and a SIMT kernel on
  `role.gpu-compute` against the same oracle, including the int32 wrap,
  single-element, and SIMT-tail cases.  Their artifacts share nothing; their
  results must agree exactly.
- `riscv-software-models.json` runs one RV32IM/ILP32 ELF on aXsim and QEMU
  `virt`. Both reproduce the exact `cpu_perf` checksum, while aXsim retired
  instructions, QEMU guest `mcycle`, simulator host duration, and RTL cycles
  remain different metric domains.
- `saxpy-software-hardware-codesign.json` first holds the source, algorithm,
  layout, runtime policy, workload, and host fixed while GCC changes from `-O0`
  to `-O2`; it then runs a complete two-algorithm by two-lane RTL control. Its
  factor table is derived from the build selectors and effective component
  profiles rather than copied into labels.

Records go to `build/experiments/records` unless `EXPERIMENT_RECORDS` points
into the evidence tree, because a scratch run is not evidence.  Every candidate
produces one, including the blocked and timed-out ones.

The summary prints each number with the domain it was measured in — `model`
cycles, `host` nanoseconds, `sim-tool` nanoseconds — and no command in this
repository converts between them.  Ranking across domains is refused by the
contract, not by convention.

`make experiment-replay` re-runs one record and compares the artifact, build,
model, and profile hashes before it compares any number; then oracle outputs
and the cycle counts that are supposed to be deterministic.  Elapsed times are
printed side by side and not asserted.  A rebuilt artifact that still passes is
reported as a different candidate rather than as the same one.

A plan may sweep a target's build-time parameters over an explicitly
enumerated set; `saxpy-native-vs-rtl` sweeps `role.gpu-compute` over 1, 2, 4,
and 8 lanes.  The expansion is finite and its size is checked against
`budget.max_candidates` before anything runs, an out-of-range point is refused
before its model is built, and the component manifest owns the range that
decides which points are out of range.

Every run writes `run-state-<plan>.json` beside the records: what was
attempted, what was reused because its inputs were unchanged, and what was
never tried.  `--resume` keeps settled outcomes -- including blocked and failed
ones -- instead of quietly redoing them, `--retry` names the ones to attempt
again, and `--max-candidates` / `--budget-seconds` bound a run and record the
remainder as not-run rather than dropping them.  `--no-reuse` re-executes work
whose inputs have not changed.

```bash
make experiment-sweep-check      # the sweep's own failure modes
make experiment-regression-check # the deterministic preview CPU gate
make codesign-check              # AX-11 controlled-factor and replay gate
```

`codesign-check` proves that a held factor cannot drift, a factorial control
cannot omit a combination, compiler flags invalidate reuse, executable,
compiler, and runtime-library identities are retained, a wrong result is
excluded, and one hardware/software result replays exactly. The recorded result
is a useful negative one: four lanes improve both kernels, but replacing
multiply-by-three with two additions costs cycles at both widths.

The per-change regression gate reruns the `same-binary-cores` preview subset:
the unchanged `cpu_perf` payload on `sim-minimal`, `sim-bram`, and `sim-ax2`.
The plan owns an `org.atomix.regression-policy` extension that pins the
workload, exact checksum, payload/build identity, and profile identity before
applying maximum artifact-size, workload-cycle, and total-cycle bounds. A
stale identity is refused rather than compared to a number from another build.
The policy revision and dated history explain the initial baseline and are the
review point for an intentional change: regenerate evidence, bump the policy
revision, append the reason, and set bounds from the newly matched identities.

Simulator wall time stays diagnostic and has no threshold. Native host timing
likewise remains the distribution recorded by the SAXPY experiment; it is not
an exact CPU-performance gate. `native-adapter-conformance` checks the native
adapter without requiring Verilator or a RISC-V toolchain, while
`experiment-regression` is the small CI RTL gate. The complete SAXPY parameter
sweep is retained as `experiment-full-sweep` in `nightly-integrated` rather
than added to every change.

Read the result, and hand it to someone else:

```bash
make experiment-report                                  # the shipped saxpy records
make experiment-report EXPERIMENT_PLAN=research/experiments/same-binary-cores.json
make experiment-report CONSTRAINT='org.atomix.metric.execute-cycles<=300'
make experiment-export CANDIDATE=saxpy-simt-rtl-lanes-4  # a self-contained result
make experiment-reproduce                                # rebuild it from that alone
```

The report reads the records this repository ships; point `EXPERIMENT_READ` at
your own run to read that instead.  It prints one table per measurement domain
and states, in the output, that no ratio between them means anything — there is
no combined score anywhere in this repository, and a host process is listed
under the model-cycles table as *not applicable* rather than omitted.  A
candidate that failed its oracle is named as excluded with the first mismatch;
a candidate the bound never reached is named as never attempted.  A constraint
returns qualifying candidates, candidates outside the bound, and candidates
about which there is no evidence — that last group never counts as a pass, so
asking for a LUT budget in a simulation-only experiment qualifies nobody.

`make experiment-export` writes a bundle carrying the plan, the workload, the
record, every declared input with its hash, and the commit to retrieve.
`make experiment-reproduce` checks those inputs still hash the same, re-runs
through the ordinary runner, and compares identity, oracle outputs, and the
deterministic values.  A changed input is refused before anything is rebuilt,
and a bundle claiming a different evidence level is refused outright.

```bash
make experiment-report-check     # what the report must refuse to do
```

Publish the records as a browsable site:

```bash
make experiment-pages            # renders build/pages from the committed records
make experiment-pages-check      # the generator is deterministic, and the pages keep their caveats
python3 -m http.server -d build/pages 8000    # read it locally
```

The site is generated, never committed: one page per experiment, every result
one click from the record JSON that produced it, every artifact and machine
hash shown, and the commands to check it locally on the page itself. It carries
the same rules the local report does, because it imports them — a page that
ranks two measurement domains has to say they do not compare, and
`experiment-pages-check` fails if it does not.

[`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](../.github/workflows/pages.yml) builds and
deploys it to GitHub Pages on pushes that touch the records or the tools that
read them. That workflow validates the records first, re-derives the native
result on the runner so at least one published number has been reproduced on a
different machine, and requires the site to be exactly what the records
generate. It needs no Verilator, no RISC-V toolchain, and no board — publishing
must not be able to change what is published.

Deployment needs one manual setting per repository: **Settings → Pages → Build
and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**. Until that is set the build job
still runs every check; only the deploy step fails. Once enabled the site is at
`https://xylene-labs.github.io/atomiX/`.

`make adapter-check` proves what a passing run never shows: the native leg
builds and runs with every RISC-V, Verilator, and FPGA tool shadowed by a
failing stub, an absent tool blocks instead of silently selecting another
target, a scalar too wide for the engine's 17-bit immediate is refused before
execution, a limit and a cancellation both reach the process group, and a
replay rejects a changed artifact hash.

### 3.5 Kernel (aXos) — needs `qemu-system-riscv32` ≥ 7

`check-boot` covers three things on the ISS, QEMU, and the RTL: the interactive
shell, fork/wait with exit-status propagation, and persistent `exec` — which
passes `argv` to `sw/kernel/userprog/hello.c`, then restores the shell instead
of halting the machine. The userspace ABI it targets is
[abi.md](abi.md); the syscall table (`syscall.linux-compat`) and the image
format (`loader.elf32`) are both selectable components, as is the C library
(`libc.axlibc`) that user programs link against.

Write a user program in `sw/kernel/userprog/` as ordinary C: it gets a `main()`,
malloc, printf, string functions, 64-bit arithmetic, and `open`/`read`/`lseek`/
`fstat` on files, and is built and linked entirely separately from the kernel,
reaching it only as an embedded image.  Files come from the selected
`filesystem` component — the SD card when one is present, and a built-in
read-only root when there is not, so a program can read a file on every profile
rather than only the ones with storage.
```bash
make -C sw/kernel check-boot QEMU=/path/to/qemu-system-riscv32   # shell + fork/wait on ISS, QEMU, RTL
make -C sw/kernel check-shell         # generic commands, parsing, and kernel observability on ISS
make -C sw/kernel kernel-component-test QEMU=/path/to/...        # default + cooperative scheduler
make -C sw/kernel check-build-identity  # a reused build tree holds the profile it claims
make -C sw/kernel check-memory          # 32 MiB cached external-memory RTL
make -C sw/kernel check-storage         # AXFS mount over SPI-SD (RTL)
make -C sw/kernel check-storage-write   # AXFS write/readback (RTL)
make -C sw/kernel check-sdboot          # SD boot: shell + fork + exec on the SDRAM pin model
make -C sw/kernel check-sdboot-exec     # the same exec at the default scheduling quantum
make -C sw/kernel check-uartboot        # immutable ROM + blank RAM + runtime kernel upload
```

`check-sdboot` selects `configs/sim-sdram.json` explicitly, prints the
component identities it resolved, and requires the run to have driven the SDRAM
pins — the counters the behavioural model keeps — before it will call a
transcript physical-SDRAM evidence.  It also proves both refusals first: that
`run-sdram` will not build an on-chip-RAM machine, and that a transcript from
one is not accepted.  Until 2026-09-06 the target named `run-sdram` without
selecting a profile, so it built the default BRAM machine and printed a
physical-SDRAM result anyway.

Shell, fork and exec all pass on that path. Exec used not to, in any budget
tried (15M, 27M, 120M): the scheduling quantum was armed at trap entry, so
service cost was spent out of the interval the resumed task should have had,
and at SDRAM latency the task retired about one instruction per preemption.
The quantum is now armed on the way out of the S-mode handler and is a
`timer_quantum_cycles` profile setting — see
[memory.md](memory.md#the-scheduling-quantum-on-slow-memory).
`check-sdboot` builds with `configs/kernel-slow-memory.json`, the profile
matched to this machine; `check-sdboot-exec` runs the same workload at the
default 2,000-cycle quantum and is the retained failure case for renewed loss
of user progress. Evidence:
[sdram-exec-progress.json](../research/benchmarks/sdram-exec-progress.json) and
[timer-quantum-fix.json](../research/benchmarks/timer-quantum-fix.json).

### 3.6 Shell control plane + host-link (RTL-only)
```bash
make -C sw/kernel check-role-driver     # aXos drives role.loopback from its own shell
make -C sw/kernel check-role-irq        # completion arrives as an S-mode interrupt, not a poll
make -C sw/kernel check-hostlink        # axhost drives loopback, TPU-lite, and GPU-compute over the link
make -C sw/kernel check-hostlink-stream # chunked GPU transfer; the three capacity settings at declared, non-default, and undeclared
```

`check-role-driver` also executes `hello.elf` in U-mode against the loopback
role, covering `role_info` plus tokenized `role_submit`/`role_wait`, retry
errors, and the kernel-only MMIO alias.

`check-role-irq` is the narrower claim underneath it: the role's level-sensitive
line reaches S-mode through the PLIC's supervisor context, and the kernel never
reads `STATUS`. It runs two jobs, because a single completion would also pass
with a handler that claims but never completes.

### 3.7 Randomized + formal (run on core / RVFI / translation changes)
```bash
make -C sim/testgen fuzz           # long randomized instruction lock-step
make -C sim/testgen paging         # randomized Sv32 paging
make -C formal check               # riscv-formal bounded proofs, reference core
make -C formal check-minimal       # same properties on core.minimal
make -C formal check-ax2           # same properties on ax2's two retire channels
make -C formal check-all           # all three cores
```

`check-ax2` uses the same solver as the reference suite but needs more memory
(its block-RAM instruction cache dominates model construction, not the bounded
depth), so it does not finish on a small machine; see
[formal/README.md](../formal/README.md).  `formal.yml` runs both cores.

### 3.8 Recommended full regression
```bash
make config-check-all
make -C sim/axsim test
make -C sim/cosim test
make -C sw/baremetal images
make -C sw/baremetal check-hello check-timer check-preempt check-fencei check-role check-tpu check-gpu check-gpu-tpu
make component-test
make -C sw/kernel kernel-component-test QEMU=/path/to/qemu-system-riscv32
make -C sw/kernel check-role-driver check-role-irq check-hostlink check-hostlink-stream check-uartboot
make -C formal check          # after core/RVFI changes
```

## 4. Deploy (FPGA synthesis → physical board)

Physical deployment is the **final evidence gate**.  Simulation passing is not
board proof.

**Synthesize hardware, not software.**  On the Gowin boards main memory is
block RAM, whose contents are set when the device is configured, so
`make fpga ... PROGRAM=<name>` bakes the program into the netlist
(`chparam -set RAM_INIT_FILE`).  That makes every program a separate bitstream
with its own placement, timing, and hash — which is how `role.tpu-lite` once
stopped fitting because of a software change.  Use it only for first bring-up
of a profile that has no loader image.

The normal path is a **loader bitstream plus runtime payloads**: build it once
per profile, then send programs to a running board.

```bash
make fpga-loader-primer            # blank RAM + immutable UART ROM, no payload
make load PROGRAM=snake            # send any bare-metal program, ~0.1 s
python3 sw/host/axhost.py --serial /dev/ttyUSB1 --baud 921600 \
  --upload-kernel sw/kernel/build/primer-runtime/axos_boot.bin   # or a kernel
```

`make -C sw/baremetal check-snake-loader` gates the property in simulation: an
uploaded program must reach exactly the state the baked one reaches.

The board component selects the flow; three boards are supported:

| Board | Profile | Flow | Main memory |
|---|---|---|---|
| ULX3S-85F (Lattice ECP5) | `configs/ulx3s-85f.json` | ECP5 | external SDRAM + fabric ROM |
| Tang Nano 20K (Gowin GW2A-18C) | `configs/tangnano20k.json` | Gowin | 32 KB on-chip block RAM (BSRAM) |
| Tang Primer 25K Dock (Gowin GW5A-25A) | `configs/tangprimer25k.json` | Gowin | 32 KB on-chip block RAM (BSRAM) |

What each board can actually run, per configuration, backed by real synth/sim
runs: [hardware-capabilities.md](hardware-capabilities.md). Board procedures
and safety notes: [tangprimer25k-bringup.md](tangprimer25k-bringup.md)
and [ulx3s-bringup.md](ulx3s-bringup.md).

### 4.1 Tool check
```bash
source "$HOME/opt/oss-cad-suite/environment"
make -C rtl/fpga check-tools  COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangnano20k.json  # flow-specific tools
make -C rtl/fpga toolchain-report COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangnano20k.json
```

### 4.2 Synthesis-only gate (no P&R tools needed)
```bash
make -C rtl/fpga synth COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangnano20k.json   # yosys netlist only
make -C rtl/fpga synth COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangprimer25k.json # GW5A netlist only
```
`synth` is the "does the design map for this board" check: it runs Yosys alone,
so it passes with only `yosys` installed. For both Tang profiles it must map
the 32 KB RAM to block RAM (`DPB` cells), not flip-flops — the memory uses
registered reads (`axram` `SYNC_READ=1`) precisely so it infers BSRAM.
Generated sources, logs, netlists, and bitstreams live in separate
configuration-keyed directories below `rtl/fpga/build/`, so switching between
CPU, GPU, and TPU profiles cannot reuse a sibling profile's artifact.

### 4.3 Synthesis, place-and-route, bitstream
```bash
make fpga CONFIG=configs/ulx3s-85f.json     # top-level wrapper (ECP5), or:
make fpga CONFIG=configs/tangnano20k.json   # Gowin/Tang Nano
make fpga CONFIG=configs/tangprimer25k.json # Gowin/Tang Primer 25K
make fpga-loader LOADER_CONFIG=configs/tangprimer25k-runtime-gpu-tpu.json # resident composite
make primer-runtime-preflight               # exact Primer runtime image + evidence; no board access
make -C rtl/fpga config COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangnano20k.json  # print resolved selection
```
The P&R tool (`nextpnr-ecp5` / `nextpnr-himbaechel`) prints utilisation and
timing at the end; the board clock target (25 MHz ULX3S, 27 MHz Tang Nano,
25 MHz Tang Primer) must pass. Do not program a bitstream from a failed or
unconstrained P&R run.

The composite loader command above is the reproducible R2 fit probe.  Its
seed-1 build places at 19,304 LUT4, 2,701 FF, 42 BSRAM and 24 `MULT12X12` plus
3 `MULTALU27X18` cells, routing at 33.18 MHz.  It resets through the immutable
UART ROM into blank 16 KiB RAM, so workload software is a runtime payload and
not part of bitstream identity.  These are synthesis/P&R results only; the
command does not program the board and is not a physical claim.

The reproducible stage-2 partial-reconfiguration measurement uses explicit
matching placement seeds and writes a JSON frame/tile report:

```bash
make -C rtl/fpga pr-delta
```

It is a research measurement, not a programming target.  On the ULX3S 85F it
also records the expected current Trellis diagnostic that delta address
encoding is implemented only for 45F; see [partial-reconfig.md](partial-reconfig.md).
The stage-3 placement-lock probe is not yet a one-command gate because its
recorded outcome is a router failure, not an artifact to publish.  Its exact
no-hardware reproduction commands and the expected diagnostics are in the
"Stage 3 progress" section of that document; `tools/pr_lock.py` and
`tools/pr_floorplan.py` are the maintained lock and region apparatus.

Two stage-3 pieces *are* one-command gates.  The allowed role region is
measured from a routed reference rather than declared, and a candidate partial
bitstream is checked against it before any load is attempted:

```bash
# Measure a rectangle's frame footprint, and whether it is separable at all.
python3 tools/pr_region.py measure \
  rtl/fpga/build-pr45/pr-delta-seed1/reference.config \
  --reference-bit rtl/fpga/build-pr45/pr-delta-seed1/reference.bit \
  --device LFE5U-45F --idcode 0x41112043 --rows 1:70 --columns 2:13 \
  --output research/partial-reconfig/ulx3s-45f-role-window.json

# Gate a candidate delta. The self-test alone needs no FPGA toolchain.
make pr-gate-check
make pr-gate-check \
  DELTA=rtl/fpga/build-pr45/pr-delta-seed1/candidate.delta.bit \
  REFERENCE=rtl/fpga/build-pr45/pr-delta-seed1/reference.bit \
  FULL_IMAGE=rtl/fpga/build-pr45/pr-delta-seed1/candidate.bit
```

`measure` needs `ecppack` on `PATH`; the gate's self-test does not.  The second
gate invocation is expected to **fail** today: the current unconstrained delta
writes 8,175 of its 8,225 frames outside the role window, which is the
shell-locking problem stated in loader units.  A non-zero exit there is the
tool working, not a broken build.

### 4.4 Program the board
```bash
make -C rtl/fpga program COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangnano20k.json  # reversible SRAM config
```
`program` targets the board named in the manifest (`ulx3s`, `tangnano20k`, or
`tangprimer25k`).
Then open the console (`picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0`) and confirm the UART
transcript; for the Tang Nano the BL616 exposes the USB serial and LED5 shows a
~0.5 s heartbeat.

For Tang Primer use the same command with `configs/tangprimer25k.json`; its
programmer name is `tangprimer25k`, the onboard debugger UART is 115200 8-N-1,
and S1 resets the SoC. The Dock has no ordinary FPGA user LED, so UART is the
verdict.

### 4.5 Persistent flash — only after a passing board proof
```bash
make -C rtl/fpga flash COMPONENT_CONFIG=$PWD/configs/tangnano20k.json  # writes config flash
```
`program` is the normal dev path; flash is persistent.

## 5. Maintaining this document

After every milestone, update this file in the same change if the milestone:

- adds or renames a `check-*`, build, or deploy target;
- introduces a new build knob (like `HOSTLINK=1`) or profile that users run;
- changes a required tool or version.

Keep the command groups and the §3.8 full-regression sequence current.  A
milestone is not done until its reproducible command lives here.
