// Shell-side isolation for the role window: the decoupling boundary a role
// swap needs (docs/partial-reconfig.md).
//
// Rewriting the fabric under a running shell means the role's aXbus slave
// stops being a slave for a while.  A role region that is half-configured can
// hold `ready` low forever, or drive it high with garbage, and either wedges
// the master that happens to be talking to it -- with no recovery except a
// full reprogram, which is exactly what live reconfiguration is meant to
// avoid.  This module is the fence: shell logic, placed with the shell and
// outside any reconfigurable region, that can be told to stop forwarding to
// the role and answer the bus itself.
//
// The register lives in *shell* address space rather than in the role window,
// because the role window is the thing being rewritten.  A control register
// inside the region it controls is unreachable at exactly the moment it is
// needed.
//
//   0x0000  SHELL_ID    RO     "aXSH"; reads as 0 on a shell without this device
//   0x0004  ISO_CTRL    R/W    bit0 ISOLATE, bit1 ROLE_RESET,
//                              bit2 WATCHDOG_ARM (when role events are built)
//   0x0008  ISO_STATUS  RO     bit0 ISOLATED, bit1 WATCHDOG_RECOVERY_PENDING
//
// While ISOLATE is set:
//
//   - the role sees no transactions at all (`valid` is held low into it), so a
//     partially configured region is never asked to respond;
//   - the bus sees `ready` asserted with zero data and no error, so no master
//     can stall on the window;
//   - the role's completion line is masked, so fabric coming up in an unknown
//     state cannot storm the PLIC with a level-sensitive interrupt nothing
//     will ever clear.
//
// Reads returning zero is deliberate rather than convenient: `ROLE_ID` reading
// zero already means "no role present" in the discovery contract every driver
// implements, so an isolated role is indistinguishable from `role.none` to
// software that follows it.  Isolation therefore needs no new software path --
// re-running discovery after a swap is the path.
//
// ISOLATE takes effect immediately and unconditionally.  Waiting for an
// in-flight transaction to retire first would be the polite thing to do and is
// precisely wrong here: the role this protects against is the one that has
// stopped answering, so a fence that waits for it deadlocks on the failure it
// exists to contain.  Quiescing is the driver's job and happens one level up,
// by polling the role's own STATUS.BUSY before isolating; the fence is the
// backstop for when that does not work.

  // ---- Rejections and the fabric watchdog -----------------------------------
  // Both counters were previously supplied only through the input ports above,

  // any input: the telemetry read "no rejections, no watchdog events" by
  // construction rather than by observation, which is not evidence of anything.
  // Each now has a producer, and they are deliberately different in kind.
  //
  // A rejection is the role's own event -- only the role knows which
  // descriptor it refused -- so it arrives on the role ABI's reject line and
  // the fence qualifies it two ways.  It is edge-triggered, so a role that
  // comes up with the line stuck high contributes one event rather than one
  // per cycle; and it is masked while isolated, exactly as the completion line
  // is, because a fenced role's outputs describe fabric that is mid-rewrite.
  //
  // What is deliberately *not* counted here: traffic the fence absorbs while
  // isolated.  Reading the fenced window is the documented way to rediscover a
  // role after a swap, so counting those reads as descriptor rejections would
  // both mislabel them -- the distinction docs/live-fpga.md draws between a bus
  // event and a refused candidate -- and make every trial that spans a swap
  // ineligible for fitness, which requires a zero rejection delta.
  //
  // The `ifdef` around both producers is not decoration.  They are not free:
  // while both counters were constant zero the synthesiser deleted them *and*
  // their arms of the 64-bit read mux, and giving them real inputs costs 2,251
  // LUT4 on a GW5A-25A, taking role.morph at one PE from 81% to 90.8%
  // utilisation and past the point where it places at all.  Gating them by
  // *value* was tried first and was not enough -- the netlist still moved by
  // 1,620 LUT4 and still failed to place at five seeds -- so a declining
  // profile compiles them out instead and builds what it built before.  This
  // is narrower than AX_LIVE_MONITOR=0, which removes the register window as
