// that isolation contains a role which has stopped responding.  A fence that
// only works against a well-behaved role is worthless, because a well-behaved
// role never needed fencing.  So the central case here (`stuck role`) holds
// `ready` low forever, exactly as half-configured fabric would, and requires
// the bus to complete anyway once the fence is up.
